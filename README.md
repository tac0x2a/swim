Yasuri (é‘¢) is an easy web-scraping library for supporting "[Mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize)", and CLI tool using it.

Yasuri can reduce frequently processes in Scraping.

For example,

+ Open links in the page, scraping each page, and getting result as Hash.
+ Scraping texts in the page, and named result in Hash.
+ A table that repeatedly appears in a page each, scraping, get as an array.
+ Of each page provided by the pagination, scraping the only top 3.

You can implement easy by Yasuri.

```


And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yasuri

## Usage
### Use as library

```ruby
# Node tree constructing by DSL
root = Yasuri.links_root '//*[@id="menu"]/ul/li/a' do
         text_title '//*[@id="contents"]/h2'
         text_content '//*[@id="contents"]/p[1]'
       end


# Node tree constructing by YAML
src = <<-EOYAML
links_root:
  path: "//*[@id='menu']/ul/li/a"
  text_title: "//*[@id='contents']/h2"
  text_content: "//*[@id='contents']/p[1]"
EOYAML
root = Yasuri.yaml2tree(src)


# Node tree constructing by JSON
src = <<-EOJSON
{
  "links_root": {
    "path": "//*[@id='menu']/ul/li/a",
    "text_title": "//*[@id='contents']/h2",
    "text_content": "//*[@id='contents']/p[1]"
  }
}
EOJSON
root = Yasuri.json2tree(src)

# Execution and getting scraped result
result = root.scrape("http://some.scraping.page.tac42.net/")
# => [
#      {"title" => "PageTitle 01", "content" => "Page Contents  01" },
#      {"title" => "PageTitle 02", "content" => "Page Contents  02" },
#      ...
#      {"title" => "PageTitle N",  "content" => "Page Contents  N" }
#    ]
```

### Use as CLI

```sh
# After gem installation..
$ yasuri help scrape
Usage:
  yasuri scrape <URI> [[--file <TREE_FILE>] or [--json <JSON>]]

Options:
  f, [--file=FILE]   # path to file that written yasuri tree as json or yaml
  j, [--json=JSON]   # yasuri tree format json string
  i, [--interval=N]  # interval each request [ms]

Getting from <URI> and scrape it. with <JSON> or json/yml from <TREE_FILE>. They should be Yasuri's format json or yaml string.
```

Example
```sh
$ yasuri scrape "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" -j '
{
  "text_title": "/html/head/title",
  "text_desc": "//*[@id=\"intro\"]/p"
}'

{"title":"Ruby Programming Language","desc":"\n    A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on\n    simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is\n    natural to read and easy to write.\n    "}
```

## Dev
